# Responsible Budget Reporting Calculator version 2

## Usage

Calculator that displays spending figures as a share of the budget over a period of time instead of flat numbers. 

## History

The original Responsible Budget Reporting Calculator was written in 2013 relied on Tabletop.js. At some point, the script stopped working. This version uses JQuery to read the Google Sheets data in a JSON format. It also uses Plotly.js to display results and Bootstrap to keep things responsive and pretty.
